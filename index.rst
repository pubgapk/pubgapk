# About PubG Mobile
PubG mobile doesn't need an introduction. Yes, it is so popular that almost every Android gamer knows this game. Stats show that millions of concurrent users play this game live and they compete each other in the battle field. Are you facing issues downloading this insane yet huge-size game from Google Play? [Download the OBB SD card data directly from this link](https://pubgsoldiers.com) and you will not face any issues.

## PubG Download Issues
Recently, I tried to download the game from Google Play, but guess what, I failed to download and install the game for an entire week. Although I have a decent Internet connection but I was experiencing an error saying "Waiting for download" in Google Play Android app.

I waited but this issue didn't resolve. Then I initiated a Google research and found that several others are facing the same issue. Now to solve the issue for other Android gamers, I found a website where you can download multiple ZIP files for PubG OBB data.

You can download PubG original file there. The original APK and OBB file is available there. In addition, a compressed ZIP file of the OBB data is also present. And the best part is the splitted ZIP archives. I downloaded about 9 ZIP parts and then joined them on my Android device to get back the original OBB file.

## How to Install
Download APK file and OBB data and then follow these instructions:

1. Install the APK file like you do normally for other apps
2. Copy the OBB file to data location. The folder name should be properly named
3. Launch the game, and wait for a second so the game will find the expansion file
4. Enjoy playing the game!!

You should be able to start playing PubG mobile game on your Android device within a couple of minutes after you will download the expansion file. Not sure what expansion file is and how it works? [Here is the official Android guide](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files).
